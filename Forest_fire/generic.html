					<h2>Abstract</h2>
					<p>Forest fires are a major environmental issue, creating economical andecological damage while endangering human lives. Fast detection is a key elementfor controlling such phenomenon. To achieve this, one alternative is to use automatic tools based on local sensors, such as provided by meteorological stations.In effect, meteorological conditions (e.g. temperature, wind) are known to influence forest fires and several fire indexes, such as the forest Fire Weather Index (FWI), use such data. In this work, we explore a Data Mining (DM) approach to predict the burned area of forest fires. Five different DM techniques, e.g. Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests, and four distinct feature selection setups (using spatial, temporal, FWI components and weather attributes), were tested on recent real-world data collected from the northeast region of Portugal.The best configuration uses a Random Forest Regression and four meteorological inputs (i.e.temperature, relative humidity, rain and wind) and it is capable of predicting the burned area of small fires, which are more frequent. Such knowledge is particularly useful for improving firefighting resource management (e.g. prioritizing targets for air tankers and ground crews).</p>

					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p> One major environmental concern is the occurrence of forest fires (also called wildfires), which affect forest preservation, create economical and ecological damage and cause human suffering. Such phenomenon is due to multiple causes (e.g. human negligenceand lightnings) and despite an increasing of state expenses to control this disaster, each year millions of forest hectares (ha) are destroyed all around the world. In particular, Portugal is highly affected by forest fires [7]. From 1980 to 2005, over 2.7 million haof forest area (equivalent to the Albania land area) have been destroyed. The 2003 and 2005 fire seasons were especially dramatic, affecting 4.6% and 3.1% of the territory, with 21 and 18 human deaths.Fast detection is a key element for a successful firefighting. Since traditional human surveillance is expensive and affected by subjective factors, there has been an emphasis to develop automatic solutions. These can be grouped into three major categories [1]: satellite-based, infrared/smoke scanners and local sensors (e.g. meteorological). Satellites have acquisition costs, localization delays and the resolution is not adequate for all cases. Moreover, scanners have a high equipment and maintenance costs. Weather conditions, such as temperature and air humidity, are known to affect fire occurrence [15]. Since automatic meteorological stations are often available (e.g. Portugal has 162 official stations), such data can be collected in real-time, with low costs.</p>
					 <p>In the past, meteorological data has been incorporated into numerical indices, which are used for prevention (e.g. warning the public of a fire danger) and to support fire management decisions (e.g. level of readiness, prioritizing targets or evaluating guidelines for safe firefighting). In particular, the Canadian forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) [24] system was designed in the 1970s when computers were scarce, thus it required only simple calculations using look-up tables with readings from four meteorological observations (i.e. temperature, relative humidity, rain and wind) that could be manually collected in weather stations. Nevertheless, nowadays this index highly used not only in Canada but also in several countries around the world (e.g. Argentina or New Zealand). Even though Mediterranean climate differs from those in Canada, the FWI system was correlated with fire activity in southern Europe countries, including Portugal [26]. On the other hand, the interest in Data Mining (DM), also known as Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), arose due to the advances of Information Technology, leading to an exponential growth of business, scientific and engineering databases [8]. All this data holds valuable information, such as trends and patterns, which can be used to improve decision making. Yet, human experts are limited and may overlook important details. Moreover, classical statistical analysis breaks down when such vast and/or complex data is present. Hence, the alternative is to use automated DM tools to analyze the raw data and extract high-level information for the decision-maker [10]. Indeed, several DM techniques have been applied to the fire detection domain. We have applied Random Forest (RF) for the predition</p>

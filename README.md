Natural Disaster , Forst Fires
We are creating an Android App that can be used as a Forest Fire predictor 
Inspiration- Trees , rare-species are most vulnerable to Forest Fires and not many care about them.This App can be used by Forest Department.

Working With App

When the Application is opened ,it fetches the location co-ordinates and the Real-Time data of the location on hourly basis and find if there is a chance of Forest Fires based on already trained data.
The map will be displayed to the user predicting the regions where there is chance of Forest Fires.The highly prone regions are indicated by a red color scattered points.Based on this predictions suitable measures can be taken by the nearby Forest Deparments 

Getting Started
Initially, User has to install the app, and allow access to their location. once installed whenever user opens the app, the app will do the rest of the things to the user

Dataset
For Training our Model we are using dataset created by Paulo Cortez and Anbal Morais (Univ. Minho). It contains 
   1. X - x-axis spatial coordinate 
   2. Y - y-axis spatial coordinate 
   3. month - month of the year: "jan" to "dec" 
   4. day - day of the week: "mon" to "sun"
   5. FFMC - FFMC index from the FWI system: 18.7 to 96.20
   6. DMC - DMC index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 291.3 
   7. DC - DC index from the FWI system: 7.9 to 860.6 
   8. ISI - ISI index from the FWI system: 0.0 to 56.10
   9. temp - temperature in Celsius degrees: 2.2 to 33.30
   10. RH - relative humidity in %: 15.0 to 100
   11. wind - wind speed in km/h: 0.40 to 9.40 
   12. rain - outside rain in mm/m2 : 0.0 to 6.4 
   13. area - the burned area of the forest (in ha): 0.00 to 1090.84
